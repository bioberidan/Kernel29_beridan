GT,Diagnosis 1
Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. Viral Myocarditis:

Symptoms in common: Tachycardia (heart rate 218 bpm), hypotension (BP 70/55 mmHg), signs of heart failure (hepatomegaly, prolonged capillary refill time of 3-4 seconds, cold extremities), decreased ventricular function on echocardiogram, elevated cardiac enzymes (AST 474 IU/L, ALT 73 IU/L, CPK 2336 IU/L), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.18), elevated lactate levels, positive viral tests for Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus, enlarged heart on chest X-ray (cardiothoracic index 0.62), and ECG changes (sinus tachycardia with wide QRS).

Symptoms not in common: No reported chest pain or preceding upper respiratory symptoms that are sometimes associated with myocarditis.

+2. Hypovolemic Shock due to Dehydration:

Symptoms in common: Vomiting and diarrhea for 4 days, fever (37.6ÂºC), hypotension, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill time, skin pallor, cold extremities, metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate levels, and history of volume loss leading to dehydration.

Symptoms not in common: Despite fluid resuscitation (2 volume loads at 10 ml/kg), hypotension persists, which is less common in pure hypovolemic shock. Hepatomegaly and decreased ventricular function are not typical findings in hypovolemia.

+3. Sepsis:

Symptoms in common: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, prolonged capillary refill time, metabolic acidosis, elevated CRP (17.11 mg/L) and procalcitonin (0.66 ng/ml), suggestive of systemic infection.

Symptoms not in common: No clear source of severe infection beyond mild gastroenteritis; normal white blood cell count (normal hemogram); preserved diuresis; no signs of severe respiratory distress or altered mental status.

+4. Dilated Cardiomyopathy:

Symptoms in common: Signs of heart failure (hepatomegaly, tachycardia, decreased ventricular function), enlarged heart on chest X-ray, prolonged capillary refill time, and cold extremities.

Symptoms not in common: Acute onset with recent vomiting and diarrhea; no previous history of cardiac issues; dilated cardiomyopathy is typically a chronic condition rather than acute.

+5. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT):

Symptoms in common: Extremely high heart rate (218 bpm), hypotension, signs of poor perfusion (prolonged capillary refill, cold extremities), and wide QRS complexes on ECG.

Symptoms not in common: ECG indicates sinus tachycardia rather than SVT; no history of abrupt onset and termination of tachycardia episodes; patient is conscious and alert (Glasgow scale 15 points).

+6. Rhabdomyolysis:

Symptoms in common: Elevated CPK levels (2336 IU/L), elevated AST and ALT, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate levels.

Symptoms not in common: No reported muscle pain, weakness, or dark urine; no history of trauma or strenuous activity; renal function appears normal (preserved diuresis).

+7. Toxic Ingestion (e.g., Cardiovascular Toxins):

Symptoms in common: Tachycardia, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, ECG abnormalities, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated lactate levels.

Symptoms not in common: No history or evidence of toxin ingestion; no access to medications or substances that could cause these symptoms; parents report no personal or family history of interest."
