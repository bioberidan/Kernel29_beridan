GT,Diagnosis 1
Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. Viral Myocarditis:  
- Common Symptoms: Tachycardia, hypotension, decreased ventricular function, elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), elevated CPK, and respiratory symptoms.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The presence of vomiting and diarrhea is not typically associated with myocarditis, although they can occur in viral infections.

+2. Sepsis:  
- Common Symptoms: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated CRP, and PCT levels, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate levels.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: While sepsis can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, the specific combination of vomiting and diarrhea is more indicative of a gastrointestinal infection.

+3. Acute Gastroenteritis with Dehydration:  
- Common Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and signs of dehydration such as hypotension and tachycardia.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The decreased ventricular function and elevated liver enzymes are not typical for simple gastroenteritis.

+4. Rhabdomyolysis:  
- Common Symptoms: Elevated CPK levels, metabolic acidosis, and potential for renal impairment.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The primary symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and fever are not directly related to rhabdomyolysis.

+5. Viral Hepatitis:  
- Common Symptoms: Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), fever, and general malaise.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea are not typical for viral hepatitis, and there is no jaundice reported.

+6. Electrolyte Imbalance:  
- Common Symptoms: Tachycardia, hypotension, and metabolic acidosis can be related to electrolyte disturbances, such as elevated potassium levels.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The specific combination of symptoms, including decreased ventricular function, is not solely explained by electrolyte imbalance."
