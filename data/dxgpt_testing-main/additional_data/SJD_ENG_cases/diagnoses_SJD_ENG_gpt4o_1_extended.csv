+5. Sepsis:  
- Common symptoms: Decreased intake, hypoactivity, vomiting, refusal of food intake, elevated heart rate (166 lpm), elevated respiratory rate (36 rpm).  
- Uncommon symptoms: Jaundice, marmorata complexion, normal CRP (1.5 mg/L).

+6. Inborn Error of Metabolism:  
- Common symptoms: Decreased intake, hypoactivity, vomiting, refusal of food intake, jaundice, electrolyte imbalances, hypoglycemia (glucose 42 mg/dl).  
- Uncommon symptoms: Marmorata complexion.

+7. Pyloric Stenosis:  
- Common symptoms: Vomiting, decreased intake, refusal of food intake.  
- Uncommon symptoms: Jaundice, hypoactivity, electrolyte imbalances."
Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. Viral Myocarditis:  
- Common Symptoms: Tachycardia, hypotension, decreased ventricular function, elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), elevated CPK, and presence of viral infection (Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus).  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient does not exhibit respiratory distress or significant respiratory symptoms, which can sometimes accompany myocarditis.

+2. Dehydration with Electrolyte Imbalance:  
- Common Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, skin pallor, prolonged capillary refill time, and elevated lactate levels.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient has preserved diuresis, which is less common in severe dehydration.

+3. Acute Gastroenteritis:  
- Common Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, fever, mild catarrhal symptoms, and elevated CRP.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The presence of significant cardiac symptoms such as decreased ventricular function and wide QRS on ECG is not typical for simple gastroenteritis.

+4. Sepsis:  
- Common Symptoms: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated CRP, and elevated lactate levels.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The absence of a clear source of infection and the normal hemogram make sepsis less likely.

+5. Rhabdomyolysis:  
- Common Symptoms: Elevated CPK levels, elevated liver enzymes, and metabolic acidosis.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient does not have muscle pain or weakness, which are common in rhabdomyolysis.

+6. Metabolic Acidosis:  
- Common Symptoms: Low pH, low bicarbonate, elevated lactate, and symptoms of hypotension and tachycardia.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The specific cause of the acidosis is not clear, as there is no mention of renal failure or diabetic ketoacidosis.

+7. Viral Hepatitis:  
- Common Symptoms: Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and mild fever.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient does not have jaundice or significant liver enlargement beyond mild hepatomegaly."
