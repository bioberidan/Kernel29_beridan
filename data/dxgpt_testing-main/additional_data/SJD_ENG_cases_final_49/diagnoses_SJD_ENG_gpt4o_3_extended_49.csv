GT,Diagnosis 1
Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. Viral Myocarditis:  
- Common Symptoms: Tachycardia, hypotension, decreased ventricular function, elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), elevated CPK, and presence of viral infection (Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus).  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient does not exhibit respiratory distress or significant respiratory symptoms, which can sometimes accompany myocarditis.

+2. Dehydration with Electrolyte Imbalance:  
- Common Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, skin pallor, prolonged capillary refill time, and elevated lactate levels.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient has preserved diuresis, which is less common in severe dehydration.

+3. Acute Gastroenteritis:  
- Common Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, fever, mild catarrhal symptoms, and elevated CRP.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The presence of decreased ventricular function and elevated cardiac enzymes is not typical for simple gastroenteritis.

+4. Sepsis:  
- Common Symptoms: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated CRP, and elevated lactate levels.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The absence of a clear source of infection and the normal white blood cell count make sepsis less likely.

+5. Rhabdomyolysis:  
- Common Symptoms: Elevated CPK levels, elevated liver enzymes, and metabolic acidosis.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient does not have muscle pain or weakness, which are common in rhabdomyolysis.
