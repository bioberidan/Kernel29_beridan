+1. Viral Myocarditis:
Common symptoms: Tachycardia, hypotension, hepatomegaly, elevated cardiac enzymes, cardiomegaly on chest X-ray, wide QRS complex
Missing symptoms: Chest pain (might be difficult to assess in a 5-year-old)

+2. Septic Shock:
Common symptoms: Tachycardia, hypotension, poor perfusion, cold extremities, metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate
Missing symptoms: More significant inflammatory markers would be expected

+3. Acute Gastroenteritis with Dehydration:
Common symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, fever, positive rhinovirus/adenovirus
Missing symptoms: Doesn't explain the cardiac findings and elevated CPK

+4. Rhabdomyolysis:
Common symptoms: Elevated CPK, metabolic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes
Missing symptoms: No reported muscle pain or dark urine

+5. Toxic Shock Syndrome:
Common symptoms: Fever, hypotension, tachycardia, gastrointestinal symptoms
Missing symptoms: No reported rash, no mention of tampon use or wound

+6. Acute Heart Failure:
Common symptoms: Tachycardia, hepatomegaly, increased cardiac silhouette, hypotension
Missing symptoms: No pulmonary edema

Given the combination of symptoms, viral myocarditis would be the most likely primary diagnosis, possibly triggered by the identified viral infection (rhinovirus/adenovirus)."
Psoriasi (OD informe d'alta: Lesiones cutáneas),"Based on the symptoms described, I'll analyze potential diagnoses for this 5-year-old girl:

+1. Psoriasis:
Common symptoms: Scaly patches, lesions in extensor areas, scalp involvement
Missing symptoms: Nail involvement, joint pain

+2. Atopic Dermatitis:
Common symptoms: Chronic skin condition, recurrent outbreaks, lesions in typical locations
Missing symptoms: Personal history of atopy, intense itching (not mentioned)

+3. Seborrheic Dermatitis:
Common symptoms: Scalp involvement, retroauricular lesions, scaly patches
Missing symptoms: Facial involvement, greasy appearance of scales

+4. Tinea Corporis:
Common symptoms: Round scaly lesions on trunk, spreading lesions
Missing symptoms: Central clearing (not specified), active border

+5. Pityriasis Rosea:
Common symptoms: Scaly patches, trunk involvement
Missing symptoms: Herald patch, Christmas tree distribution

+6. Nummular Eczema:
Common symptoms: Round scaly lesions, chronic course
Missing symptoms: Strong association with dry skin, intense itching

The most probable diagnosis would be Psoriasis or Atopic Dermatitis, given the chronic nature, distribution pattern, and age of presentation. Further tests would be helpful for definitive diagnosis."
