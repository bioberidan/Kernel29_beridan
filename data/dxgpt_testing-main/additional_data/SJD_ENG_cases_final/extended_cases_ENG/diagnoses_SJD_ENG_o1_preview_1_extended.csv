+1. Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP):
Symptoms in common: The patient has severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 3,000/mm³), which leads to petechiae and bruising (hematomas) on the skin and mucous membranes. She maintains a good general condition without fever, which is typical in ITP. Normal coagulation tests are also consistent with ITP since the coagulation factors are usually unaffected.

Symptoms not in common: The presence of hepatomegaly is not typical for ITP. Elevated leukocyte count (19,900/mm³) with lymphocytosis and neutrophilia is uncommon in ITP, as it usually presents with normal white blood cell counts.

+2. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):
Symptoms in common: ALL can present with thrombocytopenia leading to petechiae and bruising. The patient has elevated white blood cells with lymphocytosis and the presence of stimulated lymphocytes, which may indicate blasts. Hepatomegaly and elevated LDH levels (727 IU/L) are also consistent with ALL due to leukemic infiltration and high cell turnover.

Symptoms not in common: The patient does not exhibit fatigue, bone pain, or fever, which are common symptoms in ALL. However, early stages may present without these symptoms. Splenomegaly is also not observed, which can be present in ALL.

+3. Viral Infection (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus, Cytomegalovirus):
Symptoms in common: Viral infections can cause elevated white blood cells with lymphocytosis and stimulated lymphocytes. Hepatomegaly is also a possible finding. The normal CRP level (1.3 mg/L) and lack of fever do not rule out a viral infection in young children.

Symptoms not in common: Severe thrombocytopenia leading to significant petechiae and bruising is less common in typical viral infections. The absence of common viral symptoms like fever, sore throat, or lymphadenopathy does not support this diagnosis strongly.

+4. Acute Hemolytic Anemia (e.g., Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome - HUS):
Symptoms in common: HUS can cause anemia and thrombocytopenia, leading to bruising and petechiae. Elevated LDH is consistent with hemolysis.

Symptoms not in common: The renal function is normal, whereas HUS typically presents with acute kidney injury. There is no history of diarrhea or E. coli infection, which are common in HUS. Elevated white blood cells are not a characteristic finding.

+5. Congenital or Acquired Bone Marrow Failure (e.g., Aplastic Anemia):
Symptoms in common: Thrombocytopenia causing petechiae and bruising can occur due to bone marrow failure. Anemia may also be present.

Symptoms not in common: White blood cell counts are usually low or normal, not elevated as in this patient. There are no reported exposures to toxins or medications that could cause acquired bone marrow failure. The patient's age and lack of other physical abnormalities make congenital forms less likely.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (END),"+1. **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (21-Hydroxylase Deficiency):**
- **Symptoms in common:**
  - **Vomiting:** The infant has been vomiting after each feeding for the last 5 days.
  - **Hyponatremia:** Sodium level is low at 118 mmol/L.
  - **Hyperkalemia:** Potassium level is high at 9.1 mmol/L.
  - **Hypoglycemia:** Glucose level is low at 42 mg/dL.
  - **Dehydration signs:** Decreased intake and hypoactivity indicate possible dehydration.
  - **Jaundice:** Presence of cutaneous and conjunctival jaundice with elevated total bilirubin (9.6 mg/dL).
- **Symptoms not in common:**
  - **Ambiguous genitalia:** Typically present in females; males may appear normal, which can delay diagnosis.
  - **Hypotension:** Blood pressure is within normal ranges (TAS 87 / TAD 60).

+2. **Pyloric Stenosis:**
- **Symptoms in common:**
  - **Projectile vomiting:** Persistent vomiting after each feeding is characteristic.
  - **Age of onset:** Commonly presents around 1 month of age.
  - **Hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis:** Blood gas shows alkalemia (pH 7.46); chloride is slightly low (Cl: 95 mmol/L).
- **Symptoms not in common:**
  - **Hypokalemia:** Typically shows low potassium, whereas the patient has hyperkalemia.
  - **Palpable olive mass:** No mention of an abdominal mass on examination.
  - **Normal bilirubin levels:** Usually does not cause jaundice; patient has elevated bilirubin.

+3. **Sepsis:**
- **Symptoms in common:**
  - **Hypoactivity and decreased intake:** Common signs in neonatal sepsis.
  - **Leukocytosis:** Elevated white blood cells at 13,700/mm³ with neutrophilic predominance (PMN 66.3%).
  - **Slight temperature elevation:** Temperature at 37.5 °C.
- **Symptoms not in common:**
  - **Elevated CRP:** C-reactive protein is normal (1.5 mg/L), which is less suggestive of bacterial infection.
  - **Specific infection signs:** No focal signs of infection noted.

+4. **Inborn Errors of Metabolism (e.g., Galactosemia):**
- **Symptoms in common:**
  - **Vomiting and refusal to feed:** Consistent with metabolic intolerance.
  - **Hypoglycemia:** Low blood glucose levels.
  - **Jaundice:** Elevated bilirubin levels and physical signs of jaundice.
- **Symptoms not in common:**
  - **Normal liver enzymes:** AST and ALT are not significantly elevated.
  - **No family history:** Often inherited; no relevant family history is noted.
  - **Specific metabolic markers:** No results provided for ammonia or specific metabolic substances.

+5. **Pseudo-hypoaldosteronism (Type I):**
- **Symptoms in common:**
  - **Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia:** Marked electrolyte imbalances are characteristic.
  - **Failure to thrive:** Decreased intake and hypoactivity suggest poor growth.
  - **Vomiting:** Common symptom due to electrolyte disturbances.
- **Symptoms not in common:**
  - **Urinary tract anomalies:** No mention of renal issues or infections.
  - **Family history:** Often a genetic condition; no family history described.

Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. **Viral Myocarditis**:
Symptoms in common:
- **Tachycardia (Heart rate: 218 bpm)**: Indicative of cardiac involvement.
- **Decreased ventricular function** on echocardiogram: Suggests impaired heart muscle function.
- **Elevated cardiac enzymes (AST 474 UI/L, ALT 73 UI/L, CPKS 2336 UI/L)**: Sign of myocardial injury.
- **Positive viral tests for Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus**: Common causative agents of myocarditis.
- **Signs of heart failure**: Hepatomegaly, prolonged capillary refill time, hypotension.
- **ECG changes**: Sinus tachycardia with wide QRS complexes.
Symptoms not in common:
- Absence of chest pain or respiratory distress: Although in young children, symptoms may be nonspecific or hard to report.

+2. **Severe Dehydration Leading to Hypovolemic Shock**:
Symptoms in common:
- **History of vomiting and diarrhea for 4 days**: Leading to fluid loss.
- **Signs of dehydration**: Hypotension, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill time, cold extremities.
- **Metabolic acidosis (pH 7.18)**: Due to hypoperfusion and lactate accumulation.
- **Elevated lactate levels (3.6 mmol/L)**: Indicates tissue hypoxia.
Symptoms not in common:
- **Decreased ventricular function**: Not typically seen in dehydration alone.
- **Elevated cardiac enzymes**: Uncommon in pure dehydration without organ damage.

+3. **Sepsis**:
Symptoms in common:
- **Fever (37.6ºC)**: Possible sign of infection.
- **Tachycardia and hypotension**: Features of systemic inflammatory response.
- **Elevated CRP (17.11 mg/L) and PCT (0.66 ng/ml)**: Markers of inflammation, though PCT is moderately elevated.
- **Metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate**: Due to impaired tissue perfusion.
Symptoms not in common:
- **No identified source of bacterial infection**: Blood counts are normal, and no focal infection is evident.
- **Normal white blood cell count**: Sepsis often presents with leukocytosis or leukopenia.

+4. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**:
Symptoms in common:
- **Very high heart rate (218 bpm)**: Characteristic of SVT.
- **Signs of reduced cardiac output**: Hypotension, prolonged capillary refill.
Symptoms not in common:
- **ECG shows sinus tachycardia with wide QRS**, not typical of SVT which usually has narrow QRS complexes.
- **No history of sudden onset palpitations**: SVT often starts and stops abruptly.

+5. **Rhabdomyolysis**:
