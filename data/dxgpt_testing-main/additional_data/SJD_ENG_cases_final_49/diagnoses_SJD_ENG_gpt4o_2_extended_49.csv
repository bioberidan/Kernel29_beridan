GT,Diagnosis 1
Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. Viral Myocarditis:  
- Common Symptoms: Tachycardia, decreased ventricular function, hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), elevated CPK, and presence of viral infection (Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus).  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient does not exhibit respiratory distress or significant respiratory symptoms, which can sometimes accompany myocarditis.

+2. Dehydration with Electrolyte Imbalance:  
- Common Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, skin pallor, prolonged capillary refill time, and elevated lactate levels.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The presence of hepatomegaly and decreased ventricular function are not typical for simple dehydration.

+3. Sepsis:  
- Common Symptoms: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated CRP, and elevated lactate levels.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The absence of a clear source of infection and the presence of specific viral infections (Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus) suggest a more specific viral cause rather than bacterial sepsis.

+4. Acute Viral Hepatitis:  
- Common Symptoms: Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), hepatomegaly, and fever.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The primary symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, along with cardiac involvement, are not typical for hepatitis alone.

+5. Metabolic Acidosis:  
- Common Symptoms: Low pH, low bicarbonate, elevated lactate, and symptoms of dehydration.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The specific cardiac findings and viral infections are not directly explained by metabolic acidosis alone.
