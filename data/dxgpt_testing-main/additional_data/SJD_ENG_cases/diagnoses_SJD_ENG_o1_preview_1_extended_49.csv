GT,Diagnosis 1
Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. **Acute Viral Myocarditis**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Tachycardia (Heart rate: 218 bpm)**: Extremely elevated heart rate is characteristic of myocarditis due to inflammation of the heart muscle.
- **Decreased ventricular function on echocardiogram**: Indicates impaired heart muscle function.
- **Hepatomegaly**: Enlarged liver can result from congestive heart failure secondary to myocarditis.
- **Skin pallor and prolonged capillary refill time (3-4 seconds)**: Signs of poor perfusion due to decreased cardiac output.
- **Elevated AST and ALT levels**: Liver enzymes can rise due to congestion or injury.
- **Elevated CPK levels (2336 UI/L)**: Indicates muscle damage, including cardiac muscle.
- **ECG changes (sinus tachycardia with wide QRS)**: Arrhythmias are common in myocarditis.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Chest pain**: Often present in myocarditis but not reported here.
- **Recent severe viral illness**: Mild catarrhal symptoms are present, but no severe viral illness reported.

+2. **Septic Shock**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Fever (37.6ÂºC)**: Low-grade fever may indicate infection.
- **Hypotension (BP: 70/55 mmHg)**: Low blood pressure is a hallmark of septic shock.
- **Tachycardia**: Compensation for hypotension.
- **Elevated lactate levels (3.6-3.99 mmol/L)**: Suggests tissue hypoperfusion.
- **Elevated CRP (17.11 mg/L) and PCT (0.66 ng/ml)**: Markers of inflammation and bacterial infection.
- **Metabolic acidosis (pH 7.18-7.29, bicarbonate 12-14 mmol/L)**: Due to lactic acid accumulation.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Obvious source of infection**: No clear focus identified.
- **Altered mental status**: Patient is conscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15.
- **Severe leukocytosis or leukopenia**: Hemogram is normal.

+3. **Hypovolemic Shock due to Dehydration**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Vomiting and diarrhea for 4 days**: Significant fluid loss leading to dehydration.
- **Hypotension**: Resulting from decreased circulating volume.
- **Tachycardia**: Compensatory mechanism for hypovolemia.
- **Cold extremities and prolonged capillary refill**: Indicate poor peripheral perfusion.
- **Metabolic acidosis**: Due to decreased perfusion and lactic acid buildup.
- **Elevated lactate levels**: From hypoperfusion.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Decreased urine output**: Diuresis is preserved.
- **Dry mucous membranes and sunken eyes**: Not reported.
- **Weight loss**: No mention of recent weight change.

+4. **Dilated Cardiomyopathy**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Decreased ventricular function**: Core feature of cardiomyopathy.
- **Cardiomegaly (Cardiothoracic index 0.62)**: Suggests an enlarged heart.
- **Tachycardia and arrhythmias (wide QRS complexes)**: Common in advanced cardiomyopathy.
- **Hepatomegaly**: Due to right-sided heart failure.
- **Signs of heart failure**: Cold extremities, prolonged capillary refill, hypotension.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Family history of cardiomyopathy**: No family history reported.
- **Chronic symptoms**: Presentation seems acute rather than chronic.

+5. **Arrhythmia (Supraventricular Tachycardia)**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Very high heart rate (218 bpm)**: Suggestive of SVT.
- **ECG findings (wide QRS complexes)**: May occur in aberrant conduction.
- **Pallor and poor perfusion signs**: Due to decreased cardiac output.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Palpitations**: Not reported.
- **Sudden onset**: No information on the onset pattern.
- **Response to vagal maneuvers**: Not attempted or reported.

+6. **Acute Hepatitis**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Elevated AST (474 UI/L) and ALT (73 UI/L)**: Indicates liver inflammation or injury.
- **Hepatomegaly**: Enlarged liver palpable on examination.
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea)**: Common in hepatitis.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Jaundice**: Not observed.
- **Dark urine and pale stools**: Not reported.
- **Exposure history**: No mention of hepatotoxic drugs or infectious exposure.

+7. **Toxic Shock Syndrome**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Fever and hypotension**: Key features of TSS.
- **Multi-organ involvement**: Elevated liver enzymes, renal function may be affected.
- **Rash**: Often present but not reported here.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Skin rash and desquamation**: Not observed.
- **Associated tampon use or surgical wounds**: No relevant history.

+8. **Adrenal Insufficiency (Addisonian Crisis)**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Hypotension and tachycardia**: Due to decreased cortisol levels.
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Vomiting and diarrhea.
- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Hyperkalemia (K 5.4 mmol/L), hyponatremia (though Na is slightly elevated here).

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Hyperpigmentation**: Not reported.
- **History of adrenal disease**: No personal history.

+9. **Inborn Errors of Metabolism (e.g., Mitochondrial Disorders)**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Elevated lactate levels**: Due to defective oxidative phosphorylation.
- **Muscle enzyme elevations (CPK)**: Indicates muscle involvement.
- **Cardiac involvement**: Decreased ventricular function.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Developmental delays**: Not mentioned.
- **Family history**: No relevant family history reported.
- **Hypoglycemia**: Blood glucose is normal.

+10. **Kawasaki Disease**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Fever**: Present but only for 48 hours.
- **Cardiovascular involvement**: Can lead to myocarditis and decreased ventricular function.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Duration of fever**: Typically lasts at least 5 days.
- **Mucocutaneous signs**: Conjunctivitis, rash, strawberry tongue not reported.
- **Lymphadenopathy**: Not observed."
