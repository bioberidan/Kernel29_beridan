+3. Neonatal Jaundice:  
- Common symptoms: Jaundice, decreased intake, hypoactivity.  
- Uncommon symptoms: Vomiting, refusal of food intake, electrolyte imbalances.

+4. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia:  
- Common symptoms: Decreased intake, hypoactivity, vomiting, refusal of food intake, electrolyte imbalances (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia).  
- Uncommon symptoms: Jaundice, marmorata complexion.

+5. Sepsis:  
- Common symptoms: Decreased intake, hypoactivity, vomiting, refusal of food intake, elevated heart rate (166 lpm), elevated respiratory rate (36 rpm).  
- Uncommon symptoms: Jaundice, marmorata complexion, normal CRP level (1.5 mg/L).

+6. Inborn Error of Metabolism:  
- Common symptoms: Decreased intake, hypoactivity, vomiting, refusal of food intake, jaundice, electrolyte imbalances.  
- Uncommon symptoms: Marmorata complexion.

+7. Hypoglycemia:  
- Common symptoms: Decreased intake, hypoactivity, vomiting, refusal of food intake, low glucose level (42 mg/dl).

Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. Viral Myocarditis:  
- Common Symptoms: Tachycardia, hypotension, decreased ventricular function, elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), elevated CPK, and presence of viral infection (Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus).  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient does not exhibit respiratory distress or significant respiratory symptoms, which can sometimes accompany myocarditis.

+2. Dehydration with Electrolyte Imbalance:  
- Common Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, skin pallor, prolonged capillary refill time, and elevated lactate levels.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The presence of hepatomegaly and decreased ventricular function are not typical for simple dehydration.

+3. Sepsis:  
- Common Symptoms: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, elevated CRP, and PCT levels, and metabolic acidosis (low pH, low bicarbonate).  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The absence of a clear source of infection and the presence of specific viral infections (Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus) suggest a viral rather than bacterial cause.

+4. Acute Viral Hepatitis:  
- Common Symptoms: Elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), fever, and general malaise.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient does not have jaundice or significant abdominal pain, which are more typical of hepatitis.

+5. Rhabdomyolysis:  
- Common Symptoms: Elevated CPK levels, metabolic acidosis, and potential for renal impairment (though preserved diuresis is noted).  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The patient does not have muscle pain or weakness, which are common in rhabdomyolysis.

+6. Acute Gastroenteritis:  
- Common Symptoms: Vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and mild catarrhal symptoms.  
- Uncommon Symptoms: The presence of hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased ventricular function are not typical for uncomplicated gastroenteritis."
