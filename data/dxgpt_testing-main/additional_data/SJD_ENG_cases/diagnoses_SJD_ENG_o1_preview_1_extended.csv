He lives with pets, which may include cats—a common source of *Bartonella henselae*, the bacterium causing cat scratch disease. The linear erythematous lesion on the left leg could represent a scratch mark.

"Plateletopenia (a few days later, O-3002-immune thrombocytopenic purpura (pti, immune thrombocytopenia))","Based on the provided information, here is a list of potential diseases:

+1. Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP):
Symptoms in common: The patient has severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 3,000/mm³), which leads to petechiae and bruising (hematomas) on the skin and mucous membranes. She maintains a good general condition without fever, which is typical in ITP. Normal coagulation tests are also consistent with ITP since the coagulation factors are usually unaffected.

Symptoms not in common: The presence of hepatomegaly is not typical for ITP. Elevated leukocyte count (19,900/mm³) with lymphocytosis and neutrophilia is uncommon in ITP, as it usually presents with normal white blood cell counts.

+2. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):
Symptoms in common: ALL can present with thrombocytopenia leading to petechiae and bruising. The patient has elevated white blood cells with lymphocytosis and the presence of stimulated lymphocytes, which may indicate blasts. Hepatomegaly and elevated LDH levels (727 IU/L) are also consistent with ALL due to leukemic infiltration and high cell turnover.

Symptoms not in common: The patient does not exhibit fatigue, bone pain, or fever, which are common symptoms in ALL. However, early stages may present without these symptoms. Splenomegaly is also not observed, which can be present in ALL.

+3. Viral Infection (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus, Cytomegalovirus):
Symptoms in common: Viral infections can cause elevated white blood cells with lymphocytosis and stimulated lymphocytes. Hepatomegaly is also a possible finding. The normal CRP level (1.3 mg/L) and lack of fever do not rule out a viral infection in young children.

Symptoms not in common: Severe thrombocytopenia leading to significant petechiae and bruising is less common in typical viral infections. The absence of common viral symptoms like fever, sore throat, or lymphadenopathy does not support this diagnosis strongly.

+4. Acute Hemolytic Anemia (e.g., Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome - HUS):
Symptoms in common: HUS can cause anemia and thrombocytopenia, leading to bruising and petechiae. Elevated LDH is consistent with hemolysis.

Symptoms not in common: The renal function is normal, whereas HUS typically presents with acute kidney injury. There is no history of diarrhea or E. coli infection, which are common in HUS. Elevated white blood cells are not a characteristic finding.

+5. Congenital or Acquired Bone Marrow Failure (e.g., Aplastic Anemia):
Symptoms in common: Thrombocytopenia causing petechiae and bruising can occur due to bone marrow failure. Anemia may also be present.

Symptoms not in common: White blood cell counts are usually low or normal, not elevated as in this patient. There are no reported exposures to toxins or medications that could cause acquired bone marrow failure. The patient's age and lack of other physical abnormalities make congenital forms less likely.

+6. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC):
Symptoms in common: DIC can lead to thrombocytopenia and bleeding manifestations like petechiae and hematomas.

Symptoms not in common: Coagulation tests are normal, whereas DIC typically shows prolonged PT and aPTT. The patient is not exhibiting signs of severe illness, infection, or trauma that usually precipitate DIC.

+7. Hypersplenism:
Symptoms in common: Hypersplenism can cause thrombocytopenia due to sequestration of platelets, leading to petechiae and bruising. Hepatomegaly may be associated if there's an underlying hepatic condition.

Symptoms not in common: The spleen is not enlarged on examination (no splenomegaly noted). Elevated white blood cell count is not typical, as hypersplenism often affects all cell lines, potentially causing pancytopenia."
