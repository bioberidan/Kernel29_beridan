"Plateletopenia (a few days later, O-3002-immune thrombocytopenic purpura (pti, immune thrombocytopenia))","+1. **Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 3,000/mm³), presence of petechiae and widespread bruising (hematomas) on the skin and mucous membranes, normal coagulation studies, and a generally well-appearing child without fever or signs of systemic illness.
- **Symptoms not in common**: Elevated white blood cell count (leukocytosis) is not typically associated with ITP, and there is mild hepatomegaly, which is less common in ITP.

+2. **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Thrombocytopenia leading to petechiae and bruising, leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count of 19,900/mm³) with lymphocytosis, hepatomegaly, presence of stimulated lymphocytes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH 727 IU/L), and mild anemia.
- **Symptoms not in common**: Absence of anemia (hemoglobin levels are relatively normal), no reported fatigue, bone pain, or other systemic symptoms commonly associated with ALL.

+3. **Viral Infection (e.g., Epstein-Barr Virus, Cytomegalovirus)**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Leukocytosis with lymphocytosis and presence of stimulated (atypical) lymphocytes, mild hepatomegaly, elevated LDH levels.
- **Symptoms not in common**: Lack of typical viral symptoms such as fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and malaise; the patient is afebrile and in good general condition.

+4. **Secondary Thrombocytopenia due to Bone Marrow Suppression**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Severe thrombocytopenia, presence of petechiae and bruising, possible elevated white blood cell count due to marrow stress.
- **Symptoms not in common**: Normal hemoglobin and lack of other cytopenias (e.g., anemia or neutropenia), the absence of exposure history to medications or toxins that might cause marrow suppression.

+5. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Thrombocytopenia, widespread bruising and petechiae, elevated LDH levels.
- **Symptoms not in common**: Normal coagulation studies (DIC typically presents with abnormal coagulation), no evidence of underlying conditions that precipitate DIC such as severe infection or trauma.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (END),"+1. **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (21-Hydroxylase Deficiency):**
- **Symptoms in common:** Vomiting after each feeding, hypoactivity, poor feeding, hyponatremia (Na 118 mmol/L), hyperkalemia (K 9.1 mmol/L), hypoglycemia (Glucose 42 mg/dl), dehydration signs (tachycardia at 166 bpm, hypotension with mean arterial pressure 65 mmHg).
- **Symptoms not in common:** Jaundice is not a typical feature of this condition; genital abnormalities are often absent in males.

+2. **Galactosemia:**
- **Symptoms in common:** Vomiting, hypoactivity, refusal of food intake, jaundice (total bilirubin 9.6 mg/dl), hypoglycemia.
- **Symptoms not in common:** No mention of hepatomegaly or cataracts; electrolyte disturbances like hyperkalemia and hyponatremia are not typical.

+3. **Sepsis:**
- **Symptoms in common:** Hypoactivity, poor feeding, vomiting, tachycardia, slight temperature elevation (37.5°C).
- **Symptoms not in common:** Normal CRP (1.5 mg/L) and white blood cell count does not indicate infection; no fever or other infection signs.

+4. **Inborn Errors of Metabolism (e.g., Organic Acidurias):**
- **Symptoms in common:** Vomiting, lethargy, hypoglycemia.
- **Symptoms not in common:** Absence of metabolic acidosis (pH 7.46), normal lactate levels; hyperkalemia and hyponatremia are not specific.

+5. **Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis:**
- **Symptoms in common:** Vomiting after feedings, poor feeding.
- **Symptoms not in common:** Vomiting is typically projectile and non-bilious; usually presents with hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis rather than hyperkalemia; patient is slightly alkalotic but electrolyte imbalances differ.

Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. **Viral Myocarditis**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Tachycardia (heart rate of 218 bpm), hypotension (BP 70/55 mmHg), signs of heart failure (hepatomegaly, hepatomegaly of about 3 finger widths), elevated liver enzymes (ALT 73 U/L, AST 474 U/L), elevated CPK (2336 U/L), decreased ventricular function on echocardiogram, history of recent viral infection (positive for Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus), fatigue and weakness (indicated by decay).
- **Symptoms not in common**: No chest pain reported, no specific mention of arrhythmias beyond sinus tachycardia.

+2. **Cardiogenic Shock**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Hypotension, tachycardia, signs of poor perfusion (skin pallor, delayed capillary refill time of 3-4 seconds, cold extremities), decreased ventricular function on echocardiogram, metabolic acidosis (pH 7.18), elevated lactate levels (3.6 mmol/L), altered mental status (though patient is conscious with Glasgow scale of 15).
- **Symptoms not in common**: No history of congenital heart disease, no evidence of myocardial infarction.

+3. **Septic Shock**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Fever (37.6ºC), hypotension, tachycardia, elevated CRP (17.11 mg/L) and procalcitonin (0.66 ng/ml), metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate levels, signs of poor perfusion.
- **Symptoms not in common**: No clear source of bacterial infection identified, blood counts are normal, preserved diuresis.

+4. **Acute Viral Infection with Dehydration**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Vomiting and diarrhea for 4 days, fever, mild catarrhal symptoms, hypotension, tachycardia, signs of dehydration (delayed capillary refill, cold extremities), metabolic acidosis due to loss of bicarbonate.
- **Symptoms not in common**: Preserved diuresis suggests dehydration may not be severe, received fluid resuscitation (2 volume loads at 10 ml/kg).

+5. **Rhabdomyolysis**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Elevated CPK levels (2336 U/L), elevated AST and ALT, metabolic acidosis, muscle breakdown could contribute to elevated potassium (K 5.4 mmol/L).
- **Symptoms not in common**: No muscle pain or weakness reported, no dark urine noted.
