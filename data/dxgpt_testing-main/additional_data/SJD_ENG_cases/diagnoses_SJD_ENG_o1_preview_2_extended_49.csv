GT,Diagnosis 1
Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. Viral Myocarditis:
Symptoms in common:
- Severe tachycardia (heart rate 218 bpm)
- Hypotension (BP 70/55 mmHg)
- Decreased ventricular function on echocardiogram
- Elevated liver enzymes (AST 474 UI/L, ALT 73 UI/L)
- Elevated CPK (2336 UI/L)
- Hepatomegaly (about 3 finger widths)
- Recent viral infection (positive for Rhinoenterovirus and adenovirus)
- Signs of poor perfusion (prolonged capillary refill time, cold extremities)
Symptoms not in common:
- No chest pain reported
- No arrhythmias noted aside from sinus tachycardia with wide QRS

+2. Septic Shock:
Symptoms in common:
- Fever (37.6ºC)
- Tachycardia
- Hypotension
- Elevated lactate levels (3.6–3.99 mmol/L)
- Prolonged capillary refill time (3-4 seconds)
- Elevated CRP (17.11 mg/L) and procalcitonin (0.66 ng/mL)
- Skin pallor and signs of poor perfusion
Symptoms not in common:
- No clear source of infection other than mild catarrhal symptoms
- Normal white blood cell count (normal hemogram)

+3. Hypovolemic Shock due to Dehydration:
Symptoms in common:
- Vomiting and diarrhea for 4 days
- Tachycardia
- Hypotension
- Prolonged capillary refill time
- Skin pallor and cold extremities
- Signs of dehydration (elevated sodium level at 146 mmol/L)
Symptoms not in common:
- Preserved diuresis (normal urine output)
- Decreased ventricular function not typically seen in simple dehydration
- Hepatomegaly less common in dehydration

+4. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT):
Symptoms in common:
- Extremely high heart rate (218 bpm)
- Signs of poor perfusion (hypotension, prolonged capillary refill)
Symptoms not in common:
- ECG indicates sinus tachycardia rather than SVT
- No palpitations or dizziness reported
- Decreased ventricular function suggests an underlying cardiac issue

+5. Acute Viral Hepatitis:
Symptoms in common:
- Elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT)
- Hepatomegaly
- Mild fever
Symptoms not in common:
- Absence of jaundice or dark urine
- No right upper quadrant pain
- AST levels significantly higher than ALT, which may indicate muscle involvement

+6. Rhabdomyolysis:
Symptoms in common:
- Elevated CPK (2336 UI/L)
- Elevated AST levels
- Metabolic acidosis (low pH and bicarbonate levels)
Symptoms not in common:
- No muscle pain or weakness reported
- No dark urine indicating myoglobinuria
- Not commonly associated with vomiting and diarrhea

+7. Acute Decompensated Heart Failure:
Symptoms in common:
- Tachycardia
- Hypotension
- Hepatomegaly
- Decreased ventricular function on echocardiogram
- Signs of poor perfusion (prolonged capillary refill time)
Symptoms not in common:
- No history of congenital heart disease
- Lung fields are clear without signs of pulmonary congestion
- No peripheral edema noted

+8. Metabolic Acidosis due to Gastrointestinal Losses:
Symptoms in common:
- Vomiting and diarrhea leading to loss of bicarbonate
- Low pH (7.18–7.29) and bicarbonate levels (12–14 mmol/L)
- Elevated lactate levels
Symptoms not in common:
- Acidosis may not explain the cardiac findings (tachycardia, decreased ventricular function)
- Electrolyte imbalances are mild (Na and K levels slightly elevated)"
