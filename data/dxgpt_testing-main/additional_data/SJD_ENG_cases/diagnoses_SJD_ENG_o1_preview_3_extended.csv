+3. **Severe Dehydration with Hypovolemic Shock**:
The history of vomiting and diarrhea for four days suggests significant fluid loss leading to dehydration. Signs consistent with hypovolemia include tachycardia, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, and cold extremities. Metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate can result from poor tissue perfusion. Symptoms not consistent include the lack of improvement after fluid resuscitation and the presence of hepatomegaly and decreased ventricular function, which are not typical in simple dehydration.

+4. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**:
The patient exhibits extreme tachycardia (heart rate of 218 bpm), which could indicate SVT. Symptoms like pallor and signs of poor perfusion may result from inadequate cardiac output due to the rapid heart rate. However, the ECG shows sinus tachycardia with wide QRS complexes rather than the narrow complexes typical of SVT. Additionally, elevated cardiac enzymes and decreased ventricular function suggest myocardial damage rather than a primary arrhythmia.

+5. **Acute Hepatitis**:
Elevated liver enzymes (AST 474 UI/L, ALT 73 UI/L) indicate hepatic involvement. Symptoms consistent with hepatitis include fatigue (interpreted from ""decay"") and hepatomegaly. However, the absence of jaundice, normal bilirubin levels, and the presence of cardiac symptoms and decreased ventricular function make acute hepatitis less likely as the primary diagnosis."
