"Plateletopenia (a few days later, O-3002-immune thrombocytopenic purpura (pti, immune thrombocytopenia))","+1. **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia**:

- **Hepatomegaly** is uncommon in ITP.
- **Elevated LDH levels** are not typical in ITP.

+3. **Viral Infection-Induced Thrombocytopenia**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Thrombocytopenia** associated with viral suppression of platelet production.

- **Generalized petechiae and bruising**.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **No signs of acute viral infection** (no fever, cough, or other symptoms).
- **Afebrile** throughout the course.
- **Normal liver function tests**, ruling out viral hepatitis.

+4. **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**:

- **Bleeding manifestations** like petechiae and hematomas.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Normal coagulation studies** (DIC typically shows prolonged PT and aPTT).
- **No underlying condition** identified that could trigger DIC.
- **Afebrile** and in **good general condition**.

+5. **Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)**:

*Symptoms in common:*
- **Thrombocytopenia**.
- **Elevated LDH levels** due to hemolysis.

*Symptoms not in common:*
- **Normal renal function** (HUS usually presents with renal impairment).
- **No anemia** (hemoglobin is normal).
- **No diarrhea or preceding infection** often associated with HUS.

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (END),"+1. **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (21-Hydroxylase Deficiency)**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Vomiting after each feeding, refusal of food intake, hypoactivity, hyponatremia (Na 118 mmol/L), hyperkalemia (K 9.1 mmol/L), hypoglycemia (Glucose 42 mg/dL), dehydration signs, and cutaneous jaundice.
- **Symptoms not in common**: No reported genital abnormalities (though males may appear normal at birth), blood pressure within normal limits (TAS 87 / TAD 60).

+2. **Pyloric Stenosis**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Vomiting after feedings, dehydration signs, hypoactivity.
- **Symptoms not in common**: Vomiting is not described as projectile and is of recent onset (typically more gradual), no palpable olive-shaped mass in the abdomen, electrolyte findings opposite of expected (usually hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis), hyperkalemia present instead.

+3. **Galactosemia**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Vomiting, refusal to feed, hypoactivity, jaundice (elevated bilirubin levels), hypoglycemia.
- **Symptoms not in common**: No hepatomegaly reported, onset typically occurs earlier with exposure to lactose, hyperkalemia and hyponatremia are not classic features.

+4. **Neonatal Sepsis**:
- **Symptoms in common**: Hypoactivity, poor feeding, vomiting, fever (Temperature 37.5 °C may indicate low-grade fever), leukocytosis (13,700/mm³ with neutrophilia).
- **Symptoms not in common**: Blood pressure is stable, no signs of focal infection, electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia and hyperkalemia) are not specific for sepsis.

Acute infectious myocarditis (CARDIO),"+1. **Acute Viral Myocarditis**:
The patient presents with tachycardia (heart rate of 218 bpm), hypotension (BP 70/55 mmHg), and signs of heart failure such as hepatomegaly and delayed capillary refill time. Elevated cardiac enzymes (AST 474 UI/L, ALT 73 UI/L, CPK 2336 UI/L) indicate myocardial injury. The echocardiogram shows decreased ventricular function, and the chest X-ray reveals cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic index 0.62). Positive nasopharyngeal aspirate for adenovirus and enterovirus supports a viral etiology. Symptoms not consistent include the absence of chest pain, which may be difficult to assess in a 5-year-old.

+2. **Septic Shock**:
The patient has fever (37.6ºC), tachycardia, hypotension, and signs of poor perfusion (pallor, delayed capillary refill, cold extremities). Elevated lactate levels (3.6 mmol/L) and metabolic acidosis suggest hypoperfusion. Symptoms aligning with septic shock include vomiting, diarrhea, and mild catarrhal symptoms indicating a possible infection. However, the absence of a significant leukocytosis, normal hemogram, and only mildly elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 17.11 mg/L, PCT 0.66 ng/ml) are not typical for septic shock.

+3. **Severe Dehydration with Hypovolemic Shock**:
The history of vomiting and diarrhea for four days suggests significant fluid loss leading to dehydration. Signs consistent with hypovolemia include tachycardia, hypotension, delayed capillary refill, and cold extremities. Metabolic acidosis and elevated lactate can result from poor tissue perfusion. Symptoms not consistent include the lack of improvement after fluid resuscitation and the presence of hepatomegaly and decreased ventricular function, which are not typical in simple dehydration.

+4. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)**:
The patient exhibits extreme tachycardia (heart rate of 218 bpm), which could indicate SVT. Symptoms like pallor and signs of poor perfusion may result from inadequate cardiac output due to the rapid heart rate. However, the ECG shows sinus tachycardia with wide QRS complexes rather than the narrow complexes typical of SVT. Additionally, elevated cardiac enzymes and decreased ventricular function suggest myocardial damage rather than a primary arrhythmia.

+5. **Acute Hepatitis**:
Elevated liver enzymes (AST 474 UI/L, ALT 73 UI/L) indicate hepatic involvement. Symptoms consistent with hepatitis include fatigue (interpreted from ""decay"") and hepatomegaly. However, the absence of jaundice, normal bilirubin levels, and the presence of cardiac symptoms and decreased ventricular function make acute hepatitis less likely as the primary diagnosis."
